<h1 align="center">My ACSAI</h1>

This repo represents a collection of notes, tools, projects and stuff that I used while studying for my BSc course @Â Sapienza. I am (still) enrolled in the **A**pplied **C**omputer **S**cience and **A**rtificial **I**ntelligence course (shorted in ACSAI, because as it is known, the longer the name of a programme, the ~~more stupid~~ better it is).
